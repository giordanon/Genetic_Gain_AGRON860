Genetic Gain

(100 points: 90 points for final submission and 10 points for draft)

You conducted an experiment in sorghum to evaluate seed yield in 100 S1 families. The families were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with 3 replications during 4 years at 1 location. Yield was evaluated by sampling 10 plants in each plot. The average yield of the 100 families across all 4 years was 126.3 bushels per acre.

The following analysis of variance was obtained:

             Compute heritability: a) on a plant basis when there is no plot structure, b) on a plant basis when selection is within plots, c) on a plot basis, and d) on an entry‑mean basis.

2.  

    (20) 

             Assume that you would like to compare the genetic gain that may be obtained with alternative methods of recurrent selection. Your selection intensity will be 20%.  The only data you have available to estimate variance components is from the experiment above with S1 families.

2A. Compute gain per cycle for the following methods. Method 1 is based on single plant selection, selection is based on an entry-mean basis for Methods 2 through 7. Put answers in the table below (round off answers to the nearest .1). Attach the pages that show your calculations (calculations and be hand written). Use the same symbols for the variance components that are used in class.

1.  

            Recurrent phenotypic selection. Female control only, selection within plots (grid selection).

2.  

            Modified ear‑to‑row.  No selection within rows.

3.  

            Half‑sib selection, population as tester, recombine remnant half‑sib seed.  Male and female control.

4.  

            Half‑sib selection, population tester, recombine selfed seed.

5.  

            Full‑sib selection.

6.  

            S0:1 line evaluation.  One intercrossing generation between cycles.

7.  

            S3:4 line evaluation.  Three intercrossing generations between cycles. 

2B. Compute gain per year for the above methods for the following situations. Summarize your results in the following table and attach the calculations.

1.  

            One season per year.

2.  

            Two non‑similar seasons per year.  Selection possible in one season, only intercrossing or selfing in the other season.

3.  

            Three seasons per year.  Selection possible in one season, two consecutive seasons in which only intercrossing or selfing is possible.

Expected gain from selection:

    (8) 

            How does using data from S1 families impact these genetic gain estimates?

4.  

    (10) 

             Which method would you use for each of the 3 growing season or resource options if these genetic parameters reflected the components in your population? Why?

5.  

            Compute genetic gain per year and per cycle for the following methods. (Geneticg Excel spreadsheet can be used to calculate genetic gain.)

            Recurrent phenotypic selection. Female control only.

11. 

            S0:1 line evaluation. One intercrossing generation between cycles.

12. 

            S3:4 line evaluation. Two intercrossing generations between cycles.

Assume the initial values for the components of variance are as follows:

s2A = 87

s2D = 26

s2AE = 54

s2DE = 92

s2E = 52

s2 = 29

s2W = 391

With testing conducted in 2 replications and 3 environments, and k=1.75 answer the following questions.

To complete the evaluation for each section below examine the impact of one major change (run) in the magnitude of the variance components from the initial values above. A major change requires at least a 100% increase or decrease in the variance component(s) compared to the value used in the initial run.

(10) 5a. As s2E, s2, s2W, and s2GE become a larger proportion of the total variance, what happens to the magnitude of genetic gain per year and the relative performance (including rank order) of the 7 different breeding methods with resources available to advance 1 season per year, or 2 non-similar seasons per year? The "geneticg.xls" spreadsheet can be used for calculations in 5 a and b.

(11) 5b. As s2A becomes a smaller proportion of the total genetic variance while s2D becomes larger, what happens to the magnitude of genetic gain per year and the relative performance (including rank order) of the 7 different breeding methods with resources available to advance 1 season per year, or 2 non-similar seasons per year?

6.  The objective of this question is to predict the genetic gain from different selection strategies and gene action AND explain why these responses are expected. Using a line graph:

(10) 6a. Draw an estimate of the relative genetic gain for multiple cycles using phenotypic recurrent selection for yield for the following two selection strategies. One selection strategy is to select a small number (2) of individuals in each cycle, resulting in high selection intensity but also high genetic drift, and a second strategy is to select a larger number (20) of individuals, which should reduce drift but also reduces selection intensity.

(11) 6b. Draw an estimate of the relative genetic gain for multiple cycles using phenotypic recurrent selection for yield when yield is controlled by the following types of gene action. In population one, yield is controlled by genes at many loci. No dominance or epistasis is present. In a second population, yield is controlled by genes at many loci. No epistasis is present, but complete dominance is expressed at each loci controlling yield.

7.  

    (10) You conducted an experiment to calculate estimates for genotype, genotype by environment and experimental error components of variance for a typical population you are improving. By determining these components of phenotypic variance you plan to allocate your testing resources to maximize genetic gain.

Source of variation df Mean square Expected mean squares Genotype 59 315 \*\* s2e +Rs2gyl + LRs2gy + YRs2gl +YLRs2g

Genotype x

            Year                             118       61.5 **               s2e   +  Rs2gyl +  LRs2gy

Genotype x Year x Location 118 17.2 s2e + Rs2gyl

Experimental error 177 4.1 s2e

            R = number of replications per environment = 2; Y = number of years = 3;

            L = number of locations per year = 6

Determine the value for each of the following components of variance:

s2e = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ s2gyl = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ s2gl = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ s2gy = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Assume that the total number of plots you can allocate to test a genotype throughout the evaluation process is 112 (number of years X locations/year X number of reps per location \<= 112). Considering the variance components you calculated above, how would you allocate your resources to maximize genetic gain in an applied plant breeding program?

Number of years = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Number of locations per year = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Number of replications per location = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Why did you select this combination of years/locations/replications?

The final assignment is due March 25. A rough draft addressing all questions can be turned in on or before March 22 for up to 10 points.
